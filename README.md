# Thyf
Thyf, originating from thief, is a 2D platformer, where you can become a sneaky square with deadly kunai that can get you anywhere it lands. 
That is, you can teleport to the position of your kunai at any given point of time. 
Use your kunais to eliminate your targets and get around traps that any ordinary square wouldn't be able to!
